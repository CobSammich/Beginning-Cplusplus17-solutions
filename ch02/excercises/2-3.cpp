/*
exercise 2-3. Create a program that converts inches to feet and inches. In case
youâ€™re unfamiliar with imperial units: 1 foot equals 12 inches. an input of 77 inches,
for instance, should thus produce an output of 6 feet and 5 inches. prompt the user
to enter an integer value corresponding to the number of inches and then make the
conversion and output the result.
